Graphics Console Demos for Meadow
=================================

This Visual Studio solution contains three examples of how to use the Belasoft Graphics Console on a [**meadow**](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/developers) board from [*Wilderness Labs*](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/). The **meadow** board must have a graphic display attached for this to work.

The examples uses the St7789 display, but although the console has not been tested on other graphic displays, it should work as long as the displays are based on the MicroGraphics class.

You can have the whole display being a console, part of the display being a console, or you can even have more than one console on the same display.
